**Pose Detection Flask Application**

This repository hosts a web application built using Flask, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. It allows users to upload images, analyzes the images to detect human poses, and provides an output image with pose landmarks and connections annotated.

**What This Project Does**

1.Pose Detection:

The application uses Googleâ€™s MediaPipe Pose, a machine learning model, to detect human poses in images.

2.Interactive Interface:

Users can upload images directly via the app's web interface and specify a detection confidence threshold for processing.

3.Visual Feedback:

After processing the image:

Pose landmarks (like shoulders, knees, elbows) are identified and marked.
Connections between these landmarks (e.g., arms and legs) are drawn for easy visualization.

4.Real-Time Results:

Users get the processed image with pose detection results within seconds.

How It Works

1.Upload an Image:

Users upload an image (JPEG, PNG, or JPG) through a simple web form.

2.Process the Image:

The app:

Reads the uploaded image.
Resizes it to ensure better accuracy.
Converts the image to RGB format (required by MediaPipe).
Applies MediaPipe's Pose solution to detect pose landmarks.
Draws the detected landmarks and connections on the image.

3.Return the Processed Image:

The processed image with pose annotations is displayed in the browser or available for download.

Who Is This For?

This project is ideal for:

Developers learning about computer vision and pose estimation.
People exploring MediaPipe for real-world applications.
Beginners who want hands-on experience with Flask and OpenCV.
